# Employee Database
This is the Module 1 Capstone Project for the DTI Data Science Program at Purwadhika Digital School.
In this project, we are tasked to apply our basic Python knowledge to create an application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features. 
The application that I have built to fulfill this requirement is an employee database. 

There are 5 menus in this application.
1. `Display Employee Data` <br>
    The Display menu will show the data of the employees on a table. In this menu, you can choose to display all employee data, find an employee by their ID, and filter employee data by choosing the value you want to filter on. This menu has 3 submenus:
    - Display All Employee Data
    - Find Employee by ID
    - Filter Employee Data
2. `Display Employee Data Summary` <br>
    This menu will show basic statistics summary of the employee database such as the average, minimum, maximum, and median of each column. The 2 submenus are:
    - Display Overall Summary
    - Display Summary by Department  
3. `Add Employee Data` <br>
    This menu allows the creation of a new employee data that will be stored inside the database.
4. `Update Employee Data` <br>
    This menu allows you to update a certain value of the employee's data. You can choose which column you want to update. Another feature of the Update Employee menu is you can update the salary of all the employees in a department based on a certain percentage that you input.
5. `Delete Employee Data` <br>
    This menu is for deleting employee data by their ID.
