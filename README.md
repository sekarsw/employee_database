# Employee Database
This is the Module 1 Capstone Project for the DTI Data Science Program at Purwadhika Digital School.
In this project, we are tasked to apply our basic Python knowledge to create an application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features. 
The application that I have built to fulfill this requirement is an employee database. 

There are 5 menus in this application.
1. `Display Employee Data` <br>
2. `Display Summary ` <br>
3. `Add Employee Data` <br>
4. `Update Employee Data` <br>
5. `Delete Employee Data` <br>
